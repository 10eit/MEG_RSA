This toolbox adapts Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) for MEG data, addressing fMRI-based limitations in temporal resolution. Focused on implementing peer-reviewed, high-impact methods from MEG research, it prioritizes temporal dynamics and source localization accuracy. 

### Something to Notice
1. `utils.similarity_metrics.py`: Multiple similarity metrics with citable references (accessible via help()).
2. `utils.transformers.py`: Tools for constructing model RDMs from pretrained LLMs.

I will add some tutorial soon.

All implementations derive from rigorously validated studiesâ€”no novel methods proposed. Use judiciously; scientific/technical issues may be reported via GitHub issues. Contributions to error fixes are prioritized.
